      will look like <em>@username:{{ domain_name }}</em>. Changing the domain

        The configured domain name is using a self-signed certificate.
        Federation with other Matrix Synapse instances requires a valid TLS
        certificate. Please go to <a href="{{ letsencrypt_url }}">Let's
        Encrypt</a> to obtain one.
